testing git fetch and git pull command
If your workspace has no uncommitted files, and you want to copy the latest changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, then issue the git pull command.
If you want to pull down the latest changes from a remote repository without overwriting anything in your working directory, then use git fetch, and then do a git merge when the time is right.
